# PasswordStrengthApp
This project combines machine learning with data science implemented in a Python environment. Completed as my Master of Science in Business Analytics degree Practicum, it displays skills in data analytics as well as intermediate level python development using serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure (Pickle File). The project functions as a locally hosted web application whereby you enter a potential password you would like to use for a profile and the application takes the password and returns a scoring of the password strength based on a machine learning algorithm trained on previously breached passwords from the famous "RockYou.txt" file. The pickle file contains a machine-learning model developed and fine-tuned within the Orange Data Miner. To obtain the data to train the model I also used Python file handling to manually extract data into a ".csv" Excel spreadsheet where I cleaned and quantified the data. A full breakdown of the project is included in the repository as a video "Practicum Presentation.mp4" and a PowerPoint "Presentation.pptx".
