This project combines machine learning with data science implemented in a Python environment. Completed as my Master's degree practicum, it displays skills in data analytics as well as intermediate level python development using serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure (Pickle File). The pickle file contains a machine-learning model developed and fine-tuned within the Orange Data Miner. To obtain the data to train the model I also used Python file handling to manually extract data into a ".csv" Excel spreadsheet where I cleaned and quantified the data. A full breakdown of the project is included in the repository as a video and a PowerPoint.
